# Typing-Practice-Tool
This Python script is a simple word guessing game. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player is prompted to guess it. The game keeps track of the number of correct and incorrect guesses. The player can exit the game at any time by typing 'q'. The script uses the random module to select words and checks user input to determine if it matches the randomly chosen word.
